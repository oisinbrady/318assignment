Each file has been generated by analysing the orignal genomes using the tool 'assembly-stats'.

e.g: 
$ assembly-stats ../genomes/RUG824.fa >> assembly_stats/RUG824_N_stats.txt

This tool produces an analysis of the contig/scaffold lengths of the select genome. N50 denotes the sequence length of the shortest contig at 50% of the total genome length. I.e., It can be thought of as the half way point (at what contig length) for the mass of the distribution.
